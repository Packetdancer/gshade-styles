# Packetdancer's GShade Styles

This repository contains the necessary presets, shaders, and textures to emulate various aesthetic styles using GShade in a supported game. As-configured, they're meant to be used in Final Fantasy XIV with the `/gpose` system.

Each style has its own instructions to read about how to use the file, and any crediting information that needs to be present; if you're not sure how best to use a style -- because they do have ways to tweak them in order to change the results -- definitely check that style's instructions.

## Sketchbook

The "Sketchbook" preset is meant to evoke pencil sketching in a sketchbook; it can be tuned in many different ways, so that the distance fades off into white (unmarked) paper, or into the darkest shading possible. Both effects can be quite useful, depending on the situation in which you use them. Similarly, the background can be faded out entirely, or included in the image.

## OilPainting

The "OilPainting" preset is meant to look vaguely like a painting, as the name might imply. The detail level and appearance can be tuned somewhat by adjusting the pkd_Kuwahara technique's configuration.

(Unfortunately, the effect is somewhat lost when the images are resized smaller; you will want to click on the example image above to see it in full size.)
